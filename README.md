# Implementations of Dijkstra

> In this repository are three implementations of the dijkstra algorithm
> (Java-Dijkstra, Min-Heap-Dijkstra and Fibonacci-Heap-Dijkstra),
> which are used to find the shortest route from a source to a target in the given graph.

> The motivation of this work is the optimization 
> of a route-planner for the subject "algorithm engineering" 
> from the HTWK - Leipzig.

## Tested

The given algorithms are tested on real (usa: http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml) 
and generic data.

## Try it!

If you want you can use the Main to try all algorithms.
Furthermore you can generate graph files and measure some interesting numbers like runtime... .
